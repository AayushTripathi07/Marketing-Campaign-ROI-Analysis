# 📊 Marketing Campaign ROI Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing the **Return on Investment (ROI)** of marketing campaigns. The analysis is done using **MySQL** to store, clean, and process marketing data, and **Tableau** to create visual dashboards.  
The main goal is to understand which **marketing channels and campaigns** are performing well based on money spent and revenue generated.

This project is designed from a **beginner’s perspective** and is suitable for learning SQL–Tableau integration.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains basic marketing campaign information such as:
- Campaign name
- Marketing channel (Facebook, Google Ads, Instagram, Email, etc.)
- Campaign spend
- Revenue generated
- Campaign date

This data is used to evaluate how effective each campaign and channel is.

---

## 📐 ROI Formula Used
The Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated using the standard marketing formula:

ROI = (Revenue - Spend) / Spend
This formula helps determine whether a campaign was profitable or not.

## 🗄️ SQL Workflow
The SQL part of the project includes:
1. Creating a marketing database
2. Creating tables to store campaign data
3. Inserting sample marketing data
4. Cleaning the data by removing invalid records
5. Calculating ROI for each campaign
6. Aggregating ROI by marketing channel

All SQL scripts are stored in the `sql/` folder.

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard provides clear visual insights such as:
- ROI by marketing channel
- ROI by individual campaigns
- Comparison between spend and revenue
- Interactive filters for better analysis

The dashboard helps quickly identify which channels generate the highest returns.
